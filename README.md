<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Introducing Proteomics Downstream Analysis v0.1.0, a comprehensive Python package designed to simplify and streamline the process of downstream data analysis for proteomics research. This package offers a user-friendly and efficient way to handle, manipulate, process, and visualize large proteomics datasets, helping researchers gain valuable insights from their data more quickly and effectively.

Key features of proteomics_downstream_analysis v0.1.0 include:

Data import and preprocessing: Easily import and preprocess raw proteomics data from various sources such as DIA-NN. Automatically handle missing values, normalization, and data transformation as needed.

Statistical analysis: Perform essential statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, and multiple testing correction methods to assess the significance of differentially expressed proteins.

Enrichment analysis: Conduct functional enrichment analysis to identify over-represented functional categories, biological processes, or pathways in your protein sets, supporting popular databases like Gene Ontology and KEGG.

Clustering and dimensionality reduction: Apply advanced unsupervised learning techniques to group similar proteins and uncover underlying biological patterns. Techniques include hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).

Customizable data visualization: Create stunning and informative visualizations to better understand and communicate your results. Generate heatmaps, volcano plots, Venn diagrams, and more with full customization options.

Integration with existing tools: Compatibility with popular Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, allowing you to seamlessly integrate this package into your existing data analysis workflow.

Proteomics Downstream Analysis v0.1.0 provides a solid foundation for your proteomics research needs.
